            <h3 class="section-title">God did not save Himself in order to save us</h3>
            <p>..but themselves are gone into captivity. Isaiah 46:2<br>
            ..save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross. Matthew 27:40</p>
            <p>In Isaiah 46 we read about the gods of Babylon, and their powerlessness. Idols and idolaters, taken into captivity.</p>
            <p>We see the contrast between the true God and the other gods, given by God Himself through the chapter and the book of Isaiah. Our God is a living god. He is the true God, there is none like Him.</p>
            <p>They couldn't save themselves. They are dead and they <em>don't move from the places where they are kept</em> (Isaiah 46:7). They are a burden to those who carry them. But our Lord Jesus carried the cross, and <em>took away the sin of the world</em> (John 1:29). That sinless and precious blood was shed for you and me.</p>
            <p><em>Those gods of Babylon couldn't save themselves. But He could, and yet He didn't, save Himself. Why not? To pay the price. We are doubly His, for He bought us twice.</em></p>
            <p>Let us not think that we are better than the <em>descendants of Jacob</em> (Isaiah 46:3). We are idol worshippers too. Our idols may not be of stone, or gold, or silver but are very much in our hearts and minds. We have things of this world that take the place of God. Let us be very serious regarding the idols we have in our life, <em>for it is detestable to the LORD our God.</em> (Deuteronomy 7:25)</p>
