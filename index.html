            <h3 class="section-title">God Did Not Save Himself in Order to Save Us</h3>
            <p>..but themselves are gone into captivity. Isaiah 46:2<br>
            ..save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross. Matthew 27:40</p>
            <p>In Isaiah 46, we read about the powerless gods of Babylon, idols and idolaters taken into captivity.</p>
            <p>Through Isaiah, God Himself highlights the contrast between the true God and these other gods. Our God is living and true; there is none like Him.</p>
            <p>These idols couldn't save themselves. They are lifeless and immobile, mere burdens to those who carry them (Isaiah 46:7). In contrast, our Lord Jesus carried the cross and took away the sin of the world (John 1:29). His sinless and precious blood was shed for you and me.</p>
            <p><em>Those gods of Babylon couldn't save themselves. But He could, and yet He didn't, save Himself. Why not? To pay the price. We are doubly His, for He bought us twice.</em></p>
            <p>Let us not think we are better than the <em>descendants of Jacob</em> (Isaiah 46:3). We too are idol worshippers. Our idols may not be of stone, gold, or silver, but they exist in our hearts and minds. We often allow worldly things to take the place of God. We must be serious about the idols in our lives, for they are detestable to the LORD our God (Deuteronomy 7:25).</p>
            <h3 class="section-title">God and Locusts</h3>
            <h4>1. Lessons</h4>
            <p>Mark 1:6,<br>
            And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;</p>
            <p>It is weird to think of locusts for breakfast but that is what John the Baptist ate. It was a common food in the region: Locusts were considered a delicacy in some parts of the Middle East, and they were a readily available source of protein in the desert region where John was living. It was a sign of asceticism: John the Baptist was known for his austere lifestyle, and eating locusts may have been a way of demonstrating his commitment to a simple and humble way of life. It was a symbolic act: Some scholars believe that John's choice to eat locusts was symbolic of the coming judgment of God. In the Old Testament, locusts were often used as a symbol of God's wrath and judgment upon the people who had turned away from him. Regardless of the reason, John's choice to eat locusts and wild honey is seen as an example of his dedication to his mission of calling people to repentance and preparing the way for the coming of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>It is interesting to note that, unlike most flying insects, they were classified as clean animals. According to Old Testament dietary laws, any flying insects which have jointed legs for jumping, such as locusts, crickets, and grasshoppers, were clean and could be eaten (Lev. 11:21–22). Other flying insects creep upon the earth when not airborne and were therefore considered unclean (Lev. 11:20)—even though some, like butterflies, might be graceful and attractive.</p>
            <h4>What can we learn from the locusts?</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>STAYING AIRBORNE:</strong> They are jumping insects. They are not really creatures of earth. Some insects fly for a while but then walk along the ground. Likewise, the people of this world may have lofty ideals, yet they “dwell on the earth” (Rev. 17:8) and reject the God of heaven. By contrast, locusts spend as much time as they can in the air. They can stay airborne for several hours or even days. As believers, our connection to this earth should also be very slight. We have to live in the world, but our spiritual instinct ought to be a heavenly one. <em>Don't be a part of this world, but be apart from this world.</em></li>
                <li><strong>INSATIABLE APPETITE:</strong> God frequently used swarms of locusts and their resulting devastation as a tool of judgment. But from the positive side, <em>every believer should have the same limitless appetite for the Word of God</em>. Wherever we find a green tendril of truth, let us devour it!</li>
                <li><strong>DISCIPLINE AND TEAMWORK:</strong> The Scriptures commend locusts because they “have no king, yet they all advance in ranks” (Prov. 30:27). Our Lord, too, is unseen. Can we keep rank as well as the locusts? Without a leader, they are able to move in unison and organize themselves into large swarms that can cover vast areas. The power of collective action can be seen by the amount of destruction they cause. It is a lesson that Jesus understood well since he built His church with a team of twelve. Two thousand years ago, Jesus was far ahead of our management and organizational thinking—as far as earth is from heaven. He still empowers Christians with that same divine wisdom and divine capacity to build teams. In one sense, the New Testament is the story of Jesus building teams. The gospels document his initial twelve-man team, but in Acts something completely unexpected happens. That one team started by Jesus multiplies and divides into many teams scattered all over the Roman Empire, and every new team is infused with His Spirit. These teams were the early churches, and they demonstrated the unity of the Holy Spirit. For them, unity was principle one, the key to their focus. And their focus created an orderly, but not rigid, organization. An orderly organization is always the most creative, spontaneous, and alive. Scientifically called GREGARIOUS meaning social or sociable. No wonder the word comes from the root "Greg" in Latin, which means flock.</li>
                <li><strong>ADAPTABILITY:</strong> Locusts are highly adaptable insects that are able to change their behavior and physiology in response to environmental cues. Also, the desert locust usually lives a very lonely, quiet, individual, and solitary life. They are extremely shy except for their brief mating encounters. They fly at night and avoid each other, very content at being alone. Rather sluggish by nature, they are quite harmless. But when put in a crowded situation with other locusts, due to ideal ecological circumstances or the search for food, they drastically change to become very social creatures. Society is better than individuality. They are genetically programmed to change when they are under great stress, like during a great rain after drought. During all that period of drought before the stress, locusts live solitary lives. It is the solitary phase or stage of the locust. Shifting from solitary to swarming: There are about 20 species of locusts, and they all undergo a dramatic transformation when there are many other locusts of the same species nearby.</li>
                <li><strong>IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS:</strong> While locusts are known for their collective behavior, individual actions can also have a significant impact on the group as a whole. This is because locusts, like many other animals, are influenced by the actions of their peers. For example, if one locust begins to feed on a particular plant, other locusts in the vicinity are likely to follow suit. Similarly, if one locust begins to fly in a particular direction, others may follow and eventually form a swarm. However, it's important to note that individual actions can also have negative consequences. For example, if a locust begins to feed on a crop that is not suitable for consumption, it may cause harm to itself and others in the swarm. Similarly, if a locust begins to fly in the wrong direction, it can lead the swarm astray and cause them to waste valuable energy. This serves as a reminder that our individual actions can have a significant impact on the broader community, whether that community is our family, our workplace, or society as a whole. By being mindful of our actions and their potential impact on others, we can contribute to a more positive and cohesive community.</li>
                <li><strong>MAKING FRIENDSHIPS:</strong> They don't form social bonds or friendships with other insect species. In fact, locusts are known to compete with other species for resources and may even prey on other insects in some cases.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>2. Warnings</h4>
            <p>The Bible mentions locusts several times, often as a symbol of destruction and judgment. Here are some instances of locusts in the Bible:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Exodus 10:12-15: During the time of Moses, God sent a swarm of locusts to Egypt as a punishment for Pharaoh's refusal to release the Israelites from slavery. The locusts destroyed all the crops and vegetation in the land.</li>
                <li>Deuteronomy 28:38, 42: In this passage, Moses warns the Israelites of the consequences of disobedience to God's commands. He mentions that locusts will consume their crops and cause famine.</li>
                <li>Judges 6:1-6: During the time of the Judges, the Midianites and Amalekites invaded Israel and brought with them a swarm of locusts that destroyed the crops and vegetation.</li>
                <li>1 Kings 8:37: In his prayer at the dedication of the temple, King Solomon mentions locusts as one of the disasters that may come upon the land in response to disobedience to God's commands.</li>
                <li>Joel 1:4-7: The prophet Joel describes a devastating locust plague that has struck Judah. He calls upon the people to mourn and repent of their sins.</li>
                <li>Joel 2:1-11: In this passage, Joel describes a great army of locusts that will come upon the land as a symbol of God's judgment. He urges the people to repent and turn to God.</li>
                <li>Revelation 9:1-11: In the book of Revelation, John sees a vision of locusts that come out of the abyss and torment people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads. The locusts are described as having the appearance of horses with faces like human beings and teeth like lions.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These are some of the instances of locusts in the Bible. <em>They are often used as a symbol of judgment and destruction, highlighting the consequences of disobedience to God's commands.</em></p>
